# PG-Sheets Template

PG-Sheets is a set of questions to be used as guidelines for documenting Property Graph datasets, this repository contain templates of a PG-Sheet in Latex format. 

The PG-Sheets sections and questions are inspired by the 5W1H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How) writing technique, in which each section should answer one of the questions What? Where? When? Why? and How? about the data, and the answer to Who? is embedded in each section. The overarching hypothesis behind PG-Sheets is that if a datasetâ€™s documentation successfully addresses all these questions, then it can be considered complete and concise.

Each PG-Sheet is intended to provide all the essential information a reader or potential data user needs to understand the dataset, including its strengths, limitations, and context of use.
Each one of the sections has a set of questions which is labeled according to the following priority level:

1. **MUST** - questions that must always be answered and included in a PG-Sheet
2. **SHOULD** - questions that should be answered but are not mandatory to have
3. **NICE** - questions that would be nice to have an answer but can be considered optional
